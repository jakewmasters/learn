A space for me to store a bunch of learning things. 

## Go

To run the sample Go program: 

1. Install Go. 
2. Run the following command on the command-line: 
```
$ go run example.go
```

To build an actual executable (on Windows): 
```
$ go build example.go
```

This will produce an executable called `example.go`.
